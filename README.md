[00:01.13] I know what you're going to say son and you're right
[00:04.21] You're right
[00:05.06] But uh, Biff just happens to be my supervisor
[00:08.21] And uh, I'm not very good at confrontations
[00:29.71] 
[00:14.38] My Father doesn't have a spine
[00:17.51] He grovels, scrapes and tows the line
[00:20.26] Hello, Is anybody home?
[00:28.19] Completely lost, a hopeless case
[00:30.89] Hey! He'd come in third in a two man race
[00:34.58] Hello, Is anybody home?
[00:46.08] 
[00:39.01] Listen Marty, you shouldn't uh, waste your time
[00:41.64] Auditioning for these silly events
[00:44.02] They'll only bring you rejection and headaches
[00:47.21] Just look at me
[00:54.71] 
[00:49.09] I don't have ambitions, big dreams of my own
[00:52.51] Happy with the way things are
[00:54.36] Just leave me alone
[00:56.26] I don't need the headaches, too much money brings
[00:59.96] Fancy cars, tailored shirts, shiny diamond rings
[01:05.76] Don't need the complications
[01:10.29] Success is overrated, overstated, overblown
[01:14.22] Listen to my mantra
[01:16.83] Just leave me alone
[01:20.24] Is anybody home
[01:27.74] 
[01:21.69] He's right Marty, the last thing you need is headaches
[01:24.24] Right big brother
[01:25.30] Like standing behind a burger counter
[01:26.63] Makes you an expert on life
[01:27.93] Huh?
[01:29.93] 
[01:28.58] I'm the man, oh yes I am, I got this thing wide
[01:31.97] Have you heard, 10 billion served gets me so inspired
[01:35.45] Salty satisfaction, saturated fats
[01:39.20] All I ever have to say
[01:41.73] Do you want fries with that?
[01:44.97] Woah, woah
[01:46.27] I'm the man in uniform, arches on my hat
[01:49.75] And all I ever have to say
[01:52.63] Do you want fries with that?
[02:06.63] 
[01:57.15] Give me back my Prince CD
[01:58.94] Do you want fries with that?
[02:00.61] And my walkman, if you please
[02:02.47] Do you want fries with that?
[02:04.07] The answer is a question, music to the ears
[02:07.72] They'll all come back, it's just a fact
[02:10.68] Do you want fries with that?
[02:24.68] 
[02:14.15] Hey Marty
[02:15.11] Yeah sis
[02:15.74] I am not your answering service, Jennifer Parker called you, twice!
[02:49.24] 
[02:21.02] Marty, I don't like her
[02:24.18] Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble
[02:28.19] Oh mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy!
[02:31.40] I think it's terrible girls chasing boys
[02:33.79] When I was your age I never chased a boy
[02:36.32] Or kissed a boy
[02:37.64] Or sat in a parked car with a boy
[02:39.59] Then how am I supposed to meet anybody?
[02:41.65] Well, when the time is right, it'll just happen
[03:05.15] 
[02:44.04] She tells me it'll happen
[02:46.90] That the sun will rise and the stars will shine
[02:51.19] All I ever seem to do is sit around and wait
[02:56.23] I just wanna date
[02:58.39] She says she never called a boy
[03:01.56] Or chased a boy
[03:02.82] Even kissed a boy, ugh!
[03:05.51] What does she expect from me cause she can't relate
[03:10.52] I just wanna, I just wanna
[03:14.29] I just wanna date!
[03:23.29] 
[03:16.37] Patience Linda, it'll just happen
[03:19.85] Like the way I met your father
[03:21.65] Oh that was so stupid!
[03:24.32] He fell out of a tree in front of your house
[03:27.26] It was meant to be
[03:36.26] 
[03:28.81] When life rolls by so beautifully
[03:31.79] With perfect friends and family
[03:35.97] When love falls on you from a tree
[03:38.88] Well that's meant to be
[03:40.95] Know it's meant to be
[03:51.45] 
[03:43.19] You look around and you start to see
[03:46.03] That you're living out your fantasy
[03:50.25] It starts to feel like destiny, like it's meant to be
[03:55.37] Know it's meant to
[03:57.12] You were sent to
[03:58.85] Must be meant to be
[04:08.35] 
[04:01.96] Anyway
[04:02.53] Grandpa found your father lying in the street
[04:05.49] And brought him into the house
[04:07.64] My heart just went out to him
[04:10.10] So we went to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance
[04:12.63] Our first date
[04:14.55] He kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor
[04:42.55] 
[04:19.08] There was something about that boy
[04:21.96] Hello, Is anybody home?
[04:26.14] There was something about that boy
[04:28.74] Hello, hello, hello
[04:38.24] 
[04:32.08] And now the walls just keep closing in
[04:35.45] And I don't know if I'll ever win
[04:38.65] It's just the same as it's always been
[04:42.37] No go, hello, too slow, hello
[04:56.87] 
[04:46.23] Hello! Don't need the complications (ahh; do you want fries with that?)
[04:49.81] Or precious situations (hello; I just wanna date)
[04:52.41] Know it's meant to be (hello, Is anybody home?)
[04:55.54] Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
